        <h1>Common exercises</h1>
        <p>
          The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do
          as part of their daily exercise routine
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Burpee</dt>
          <dd>
            Burpees are a great, full body exercise to increase your strength
            and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and
            extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then jump up from
            a squatted position
          </dd>
          <dt>Plank</dt>
          <dd>
            Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push
            up position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position
            as long as you can.
          </dd>
          <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
          <dd>
            Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on
            the floor in a push up position, then bring one knee up to your
            chest and then switch as quickly as you can(as though you are
            climbing a mountain).
