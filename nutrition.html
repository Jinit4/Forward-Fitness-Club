          <h3>Food for thoughts</h3>
          <img
            src="images/food-thought.jpg"

          <p>
            Good nutrition is a lifestyle, not a diet. It starts with a new way
            of thinking about food. Think of your body as a vehicle that uses
            food for fuel. Fill your tank with the right type of fuel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do not approach your nutrition plan as a diet plan, but rather, a
            lifestyle change. If you make a permanent change, you will see big
            results. The key to success is a daily focus on your goal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Portion your meals and track your calories. There are many free
            mobile apps available to help track your activity level and
            calories.
          </p>
          <p>
            Control impulsive urges to buy junk food, and instead, allow
            yourself to one "cheat" meal for a week.

          <h3>What to Eat</h3>

            alt="fresh vegetables, fruit, eggs, and nuts"
            class="round"
          />
          <p>Use the following as a guidline:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Protein, such as eggs, chicken, and lean red meat</li>
            <li>Vegetables, but avoid corn and peas</li>
            <li>Fruits</li>
            <li>Fat, such as olive oil, nuts, and seeds</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Limit the consumption of bread, pasta, white potatoes, and processed
            food. These food are high in carbohydrates.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you shop for groceries, shop the outside aisles and buy
            organise when possible. Stock up on fresh vegetables, almond flour,
            and flax seed.
